# HNW

I'm calling this whiplash now.

## Things to figure out/and actually do
* Add cool effects that add character to the noise
* Make a decent GUI and maybe make a good theme
* Figure out if I have to license this under a VST license or if I can get away with licensing my code under a BSD-3 license because I like that license a lot
* Figure out what else I need to add to this there's probably more
