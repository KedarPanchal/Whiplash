## Filters overview

---
* The `Attack`, `Decay`, `Sustain`, and `Release` filters provide a standard ADSR envelope that most other synths have.
* `Wail` increases the resonance of the sound, creating a wailing effect when increased.
* The `Volume` filter changes the output gain of the synthesizer.
* The `Depth` filter transposes the pitch of the synth one octave down or one octave up.
* The remainder of the filters apply various distortion effects that can change the texture of the noise when used in tandem with one another and the other filters described above.
