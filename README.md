# HNW

I'm calling this whiplash now.

## Things to figure out/and actually do
* Make a decent GUI background (I already got the knobs figured out)
* Figure out if I have to license this under a VST license or if I can get away with licensing my code under a BSD-3 license because I like that license a lot
